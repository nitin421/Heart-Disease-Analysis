# Heart-Disease-Analysis
Overview
This project explores a dataset related to heart disease and aims to provide insights into various factors contributing to heart conditions. Through data visualization techniques using Seaborn, it analyzes patterns and correlations in the dataset, helping to better understand the data and potentially guide future predictive models.

Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn visualizations
Analysis of key factors influencing heart disease
In-depth examination of correlations between variables
Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains various health-related metrics such as:

Age
Sex
Chest pain type
Resting blood pressure
Cholesterol
Fasting blood sugar
Resting electrocardiographic results
Maximum heart rate achieved
Exercise-induced angina
ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
Target (presence of heart disease)
